#### Tutorial Arrangement

Students need to attend **ONE** tutorial session face-to-face **EVERY WEEK** to accomplish the **10** tutorials required in this course. The overall average grade of all the tutorials (except the quiz and the final project presentation) counts as 10% of the final grade. 

There are five available tutorial sessions each Monday and five each Tuesday. Please pick a suitable tutorial session to register. Selections need to be done from 0:00 on January 23rd to 23:59 on January 26th. Every tutorial session is set with a maximum limitation of 13 students during the registry period, which works as **FIRST COME FIRST SERVE**. You can change your tutorial session multiple times during the opening period. Currently, the registry system is closed.

After the registry, please feel free to contact the teaching assistants (TAs) if you want to move to another session temporarily or permanently. The TAs will approve the cases after consideration. 

From T1 to T8, students will be asked to form smaller groups to accomplish some group tasks. TAs will observe every student and give a suitable mark. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is allowed to be used in these tutorials. Nonetheless, students are required to summarize all the information they gather and describe their answers based on their understanding. Directly copying the content generated by GenAI is not allowed.
