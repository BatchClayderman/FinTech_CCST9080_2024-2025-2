#### Guidelines for Revision Traces

Here are some guidelines for revision traces. You can also use any other method or color to accomplish the highlighting. 

1) If you have not started your modifications yet and you are using a "*.doc" or "*.docx" file, you can enter the revision mode and start your modifications. There would be revision traces in the file automatically. 
2) If you are using LaTeX, you can use LaTeX commands like "\textcolor{red}{...}" (... is your content) to highlight the modifications. Meanwhile, you can use some LaTeX comparison tools to help you highlight the modifications automatically. 
3) If you do not meet 1) or 2), you can directly highlight the modifications by changing the background color to yellow via a PDF editor.

If making traces takes too much time, please just upload a final version without any modification traces. We will manually locate the corresponding positions accordingly to check whether you have addressed the comments after evaluating the final report.
