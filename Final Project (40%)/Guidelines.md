#### Guidelines

The final project (group project) contributes 40% to the final score (20% f2f presentation + 20% final report). Here are some details about the final project. 

(1) The final project should be teamed up by 3-5 students per final project group. Any topics related to FinTech can be selected as the final project topic. You can refer to, but not be limited to, the examples provided by Prof. Yiu. If you find it difficult to form a group of 3-5, you can publish an announcement or ask the TAs for arrangements. If you do not wish to form a group of 3-5, please seek approval from Prof. Yiu and forward the approval emails with the whole conversation history to the TAs. 

(2) You can form the final project group with members from different tutorial sessions. Nonetheless, it is highly recommended that most members come from the same tutorial session, such that we can arrange your presentation with minimal conflicts. For groups with members from different tutorial sessions, we will set the tutorial sessions in the tutorial for the final project presentation to the session where the most members are from by default. Members from these groups can also send requests to TAs to select a suitable tutorial session for the final project presentation. 

(3) Please use the following format to prepare your final project information and send it to the TAs for registration at or before 23:59 on February 26th, 2025 (Wednesday). 

```
Topic: XXX (Leave it blank if you have not determined)

Final project group information: 
Student 1 (UID): email 1 (Tutorial Session X)
Student 2 (UID): email 2 (Tutorial Session X)
Student 3 (UID): email 3 (Tutorial Session X)
...
```

If your topic has not been decided yet at this time, please leave the topic above blank when you send emails for final project group registration. You can attend more lectures first to explore the topic that really interests you. 

(4) Please use the following format to prepare your final project topic and send it to the TAs at or before 23:59 on March 26th, 2025 (Wednesday). 

```
Group ID: 
Topic:  
```

(5) If you wish to change the final project information, like topics and final project group members, after the registration, please send your updated information via email again. We will send an email to inform you whether the update is approved. 

(6) Before the final project presentation, students need to have a draft report ("*.pdf") and prepare some slides ("*.ppt"/"*.pptx" and "*.pdf"). Each group is required to submit a draft report in the form of a single PDF via the "Final Project Submission (Draft)" entry on HKU Moodle at or before 23:59 on April 23rd, 2025 (Wednesday). Submissions of slides are optional. We will copy your slides to the device in the venue if they are submitted. Please include your group ID and clearly indicate whether the file is the report or the slides in the name of each file to be submitted (e.g., "G1Report.pdf"). 

(7) During the final project presentation, each group will have a maximum of 12 minutes for introduction, a maximum of 3 minutes for Q&A with other groups and TAs, and a total of 15 minutes at most (introduction + Q&A + feedback). TAs will also comment on each report to help improve its quality. As the presentation to be held in Tutorial 10 is a part of the final project accomplishment, all members of the group project should show up on the project presentation without excuse. Additionally, students should arrive at the designated venue before the start time of their tutorial session and remain until the end of the tutorial session. Please always keep quiet while others are introducing their projects. Students are welcome to use one of their own devices or the one provided by the venue for presentations, as long as the content can be displayed on the large screen in the venue. It is highly recommended that you debug or test the equipment in advance during the last break before your tutorial session. 

(8) After the final project presentation, please revise your reports according to the feedback given during the presentation. Each group is required to submit the final report in the form of a single PDF via the "Final Project Submission (Final)" entry on HKU Moodle at or before 23:59 on May 2nd, 2025 (Friday). Besides the clean version, please also submit a revision version with revision traces highlighted in another PDF. Please use your group ID to name the file to be submitted. 

(9) The slides, used for presentation only, should act as a summary of your report. Thus, please do not include the slides in the PDF. Of course, if some figures drawn by PPT/PPTX are used in the report, you can embed them in your report. Please note that the final project report, no matter whether it is a draft or the final version, is something like the one submitted for the accomplishment of Assignment 1. However, there are no page limitations. Please coordinate within your group to guarantee that only one group member submits the files mentioned above on behalf of all the members, as we do not need multiple copies of the same report from each group member. If multiple different files are submitted in the same group, we will refer to the last report and send emails for further confirmation. 

(10) Please ensure to include the names and UIDs of all group members in your reports. Completing the final project signifies the completion of this course. At that time, we are confident that you have gained valuable knowledge from this course and are poised for a brighter future.
