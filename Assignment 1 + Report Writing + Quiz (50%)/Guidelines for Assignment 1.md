#### Guidelines for Assignment 1

Assignment 1, a group task, is released today (February 12th, 2025) and will be due at 23:59 on February 26th, 2025 (Wednesday). Please read the attachment(s) carefully in the submission entry. To accomplish Assignment 1, there should be 3-5 students in each group, which can be the same or different from any tutorial session group and the final project group. Please also feel free to form groups with members from different tutorial sessions as no oral presentations are required for Assignment 1. If you find it difficult to form a group of 3-5, you can publish an announcement or ask the TAs for arrangements. If you do not wish to form a group of 3-5, please seek approval from Prof. Yiu and forward the approval emails with the whole conversation history to TAs. 

The following are some tips for Assignment 1 for reference only, which should include most queries from students. To begin, consider selecting two different blockchain platforms. For Part 1, introduce both platforms and make comparisons from various aspects. Analyze the reasons for the comparison results. For Part 2, you should further choose a specific existing application that fits one of the two blockchain platforms instead of the other and explain why by analyzing and comparing the selected application in both blockchains. For example, you can demonstrate how the Hyperledger Fabric platform fits Supply Chain Management better than the Ethereum platform. To make the two parts sound more logical, you can use the findings in Part 2 to support your findings in Part 1, where there can be some common and different features in the two parts. 

For the writing style, you can refer to that of an academic paper, where the sections between the Introduction and the Conclusion(s) should be structured according to Assignment 1. For example, you can use a report title, an abstract, an Introduction section, several body sections, and a conclusion to structure the body pages by referring to the academic paper writing style. When citing references, any citation marker and reference style is supported. Nonetheless, please use the same style to mark citation(s) and cite reference(s) throughout the report. Multiple references cited should be systematic, most of which should be up-to-date, representing state-of-the-art work. Papers from known journals or conferences and official online sources are highly recommended. Remember to use the citation marker(s) like "Zhong et al. [1] proposed a method. " in the body content to cite the corresponding reference(s) while listing the reference(s) after the body page(s). 

Late submissions, page limit exceeding, and poor typesetting that affects reading and understanding may result in penalty scores, as appropriate. Please submit your report with only a single PDF file in the HKU Moodle in time, where the language used must be English. Make sure that the PDF file uploaded to HKU Moodle is readable and includes the full names with the corresponding UIDs of all the group members. Each report should have at most 5 body pages (A4), where the content should be clear, the typesetting should be suitable, and the materials like figures should have adequate resolution. For example, using very tiny font sizes, unrecognized font families, or unclear screenshots on large sizes of pages like A1 to include plenty of words or materials in the report is restrictedly disallowed. If you do not know what fonts are suitable or you are new to academic writing, "Times New Roman" can be a satisfactory font with "16 pt" for the section title, "14 pt" for the subsection title, and "12 pt" for the body content. Additionally, using LaTeX to perform typesetting is encouraged. If you want to use mature LaTeX templates, the common Elsevier template, the IEEE journal template, the IEEE conference template, the Springer template, and templates from top journals or conferences are encouraged. Thus, please feel free to use any formatting tool as long as it can convert sources to a PDF file for submission. 

Besides the five body pages, a report can have the cover page(s) (before the body page(s)), the reference(s) (after the body page(s)), and the appendix(es) (after the reference(s)). These components should not be written in the body page(s) and they do not count for the 5-page limitation. The cover page(s) and appendix(es) are optional. These two optional components may not affect the scores since scorers are not required to read them. For example, you can select whether to use the cover page(s) to include the names and the UIDs or to write them directly at the beginning of the first body page. If necessary, please write the contributions of each group member on the cover page(s) or in the appendix(es). Otherwise, all the authors will be treated as contributing equally to the report. You may also wish to put some unimportant materials in the appendix(es), which are not required to be read during grading. Additionally, please write the non-body page(s) in stand-alone page(s) instead of mixing them with the body pages. 

Please coordinate within your group to guarantee that only one group member submits the project report on behalf of all the members, as we do not need multiple copies of the same report from each group member. If multiple different reports are submitted in the same group, we will refer to the last report and send emails for further confirmation. 

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the TAs. We are glad to offer our assistance.
